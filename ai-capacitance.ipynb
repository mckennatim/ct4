    "- DC voltage is constant, so once the capacitor charges to that voltage, no more current flows (like an open circuit)\n",
    "- AC voltage constantly changes, so the capacitor continuously charges and discharges, allowing current to flow\n",

    "Good question! You're right to question that - **you don't necessarily need electrolytic**, and there are good reasons to consider alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why I Initially Said Electrolytic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High capacitance (470-680µF) in small package** - electrolytics are cheap and compact for large values\n",
    "2. **Common in hobbyist circuits** - most tutorials show electrolytics for this application\n",
    "3. **Cost** - electrolytics are much cheaper for large values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why You Might NOT Want Electrolytic\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Polarity Constraints**\n",
    "- Must be installed correctly or they fail/explode\n",
    "- If your CT could ever reverse (it shouldn't, but.. .), electrolytic won't like it\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Lifespan Issues**\n",
    "- Electrolytics dry out over time (5-10 years typical)\n",
    "- Temperature sensitive\n",
    "- Not ideal for \"install and forget\" applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance)**\n",
    "- Electrolytics have higher ESR than film caps\n",
    "- Can affect signal quality slightly\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Leakage Current**\n",
    "- Electrolytics leak more DC current\n",
    "- Could slightly affect your bias point stability\n",

    "## Better Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Film Capacitors (Polyester/MKT or Polypropylene)**\n",

    "- **Non-polarized** - can be installed either way\n",
    "- **Long life** - 20+ years\n",
    "- **Low ESR** - better signal quality\n",
    "- **Stable** - less temperature/aging drift\n",
    "- **More reliable** for long-term installations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Larger physical size** - 470µF film cap is much bigger than electrolytic\n",
    "- **More expensive** - typically 3-10x the cost\n",

    "Let me recalculate for your **actual** circuit impedance... \n",
    "\n",
    "## Recalculating for Your Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Your **load impedance** isn't just the 53Ω CT - it's the **parallel combination** of:\n",
    "- CT:  53Ω\n",
    "- R1 || R2: 100kΩ || 150kΩ = 60kΩ\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 60kΩ >> 53Ω, the AC impedance is essentially **53Ω**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But actually, for the **cutoff frequency**, what matters is the impedance that C1 sees:\n",
    "\n",
    "**C1 sees:** CT (53Ω) in series with [R1 || R2] = 53Ω + 60kΩ ≈ **60kΩ**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the actual cutoff: \n",
    "```\n",
    "fc = 1 / (2π × R × C)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where R = R1 || R2 = 60kΩ (approximately, since 53Ω is negligible)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For fc = 5 Hz: \n",
    "C = 1 / (2π × 60,000 × 5) ≈ 0.53 µF\n",

    "   - Example:  Vishay MKT series, WIMA MKS series\n",
    "   - Cost: ~$0.50-1.00\n",
    "   - Size: ~10mm x 5mm\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Polypropylene (MKP) - Even Better:**\n",
    "   - 1µF 100V polypropylene\n",
    "   - Example:  WIMA MKP2 series\n",
    "   - Lower loss, better for AC\n",
    "   - Cost: ~$1-2\n",
    "   - Size: Similar\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If you already have electrolytics:**\n",
    "   - 1µF to 10µF electrolytic works fine\n",
    "   - Much smaller than 470µF\n",
    "   - Just watch polarity:  + terminal to bias point (1.5V)\n",

    "## Why I Made the Error\n",
    "\n",
    "I incorrectly calculated using **only** the 53Ω CT impedance, but for the **high-pass filter** cutoff, the relevant impedance is the **bias network** (R1||R2 = 60kΩ), which is much higher. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 53Ω only matters for loading the voltage divider with AC current, which is minimal with 60kΩ bias resistors.\n",

    "## Final Recommendation for Your Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
