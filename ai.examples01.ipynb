    "\n",
    "**EmonLib** is the de facto standard for CT-based energy monitoring, but the original version requires modifications for ESP32 compatibility. Use an ESP32-specific fork:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Install the modified EmonLib that supports ESP32's 12-bit ADC and 3.3V operation\n",
    "- **PlatformIO Install**: Add to your `platformio.ini`:\n",

    "**Critical for 6 CTs**: ESP32's internal ADC has limitations when WiFi is active (ADC2 becomes unavailable) . For reliable 6-channel monitoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: External ADC (Recommended)\n",
    "Use **ADS1115** 4-channel 16-bit ADC modules:\n",

    "## Accuracy Issues with EmonLib-ESP32 on ESP32 ADC1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using EmonLib-ESP32 with ESP32's ADC1 introduces several **measurable accuracy problems** that are particularly problematic for energy monitoring with CT sensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Non-Linear Response**\n",
    "The ESP32 ADC exhibits **strong non-linearity**, especially at:\n",
    "- **Low voltages**: Cannot distinguish between 0V and ~0.13V - both read as 0 \n",
    "- **High voltages**: Cannot distinguish between 3.2V and 3.3V - both read as 4095 \n",
    "- **Mid-range variations**: The attenuation circuit (ADC_ATTEN_DB_11) introduces non-linear behavior across the range \n",
    "\n",
    "For CT monitoring, your signal centers around 1.65V bias. Small current variations (low power devices) may fall into the non-linear region where measurement accuracy degrades significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Reference Voltage Variations**\n",
    "The ESP32 uses an internal 1.1V reference that **varies by ±10%** between chips (1.0V to 1.2V) . This causes:\n",
    "- **Chip-to-chip inconsistency**: Your calibration constant for one ESP32 won't work on another\n",
    "- **Systematic offset**: Measurements can be off by 100mV or more compared to actual voltage \n",
    "- **Temperature drift**: The reference voltage changes with temperature, affecting long-term stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Electrical Noise**\n",
    "The ESP32 ADC is **notoriously noisy** :\n",
    "- **Random fluctuations** in readings even with stable input signals\n",
    "- **WiFi interference**: ADC1 can still pick up noise from the WiFi module despite using different ADC blocks\n",
    "- **Switching noise**: Digital activity on the chip couples into analog inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "For your 6 CT setup, noise becomes cumulative, making it difficult to distinguish small loads from background noise. Users report \"phantom\" readings of 0.20-0.30A with no load attached .\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Resolution Limitations with EmonLib's Sampling**\n",
    "EmonLib typically uses **1480 samples per measurement cycle**. The ESP32's ADC timing constraints mean:\n",
    "- **Insufficient sampling rate**: May miss high-frequency components of the current waveform\n",
    "- **ADC conversion time**: The ESP32 ADC conversion time is slower than dedicated energy monitoring ICs\n",
    "- **CPU interference**: RTOS task switching can introduce jitter in sampling intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **GPIO-Specific Issues**\n",
    "- **GPIO 36 & 39**: Used by the internal hall sensor; when SARADC power is enabled, these pins experience pulldown glitches (~80ns) that affect low-level signal measurement \n",
    "- **Shared ADC channels**: All ADC1 channels share the same ADC core, so measuring 6 CTs sequentially introduces small but consistent timing offsets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Calibration Challenges**\n",
    "- **No built-in calibration (older ESP32)**: Pre-2019 ESP32 chips lack factory calibration eFuse \n",
    "- **Software calibration complexity**: Requires measuring known reference voltages and creating lookup tables or correction curves \n",
    "- **Per-channel calibration needed**: Each of your 6 CT inputs may require individual calibration due to ADC non-linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Impact on Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For **6 CTs monitoring solar panels and heat pumps**:\n",
    "- **Small loads** (< 100W at 220V = ~0.45A) may not register accurately or at all\n",
    "- **Mid-range accuracy** (500-2000W) might be within ±5-10% after careful calibration\n",
    "- **High accuracy requirements** (for net metering calculations) will be challenging without external ADC\n",
    "- **Phantom readings** will make it difficult to detect when devices are truly off\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Without switching to external ADC, you can partially address these issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add hardware filtering**: 100nF ceramic capacitor on each ADC input to ground \n",
    "2. **Increase oversampling**: Use EmonLib's `calcIrms()` with 2000+ samples instead of 1480\n",
    "3. **Calibrate individually**: Use a reference meter on each CT circuit to derive per-channel calibration constants\n",
    "4. **Avoid problematic pins**: Don't use GPIO 36/39, stick to GPIO 32-35\n",
    "5. **Post-processing**: Implement software filters to remove noise and correct for non-linearity in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for professional-grade accuracy with 6 channels, the **ADS1115 external ADC** remains the recommended approach, as it provides 16-bit resolution, better linearity, and isolation from ESP32's inherent ADC limitations ."

    "## ADS1115\n",
    "Yes, the ADS1115 can work accurately at low input voltages when properly configured, thanks to its programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and high-resolution 16-bit architecture. Here’s what you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Performance at Low Voltages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excellent Resolution Capability**\n",
    "The ADS1115's PGA allows you to select gain settings that effectively \"zoom in\" on small voltage ranges, providing exceptional resolution for low-level signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smallest range**: ±0.256V full-scale (gain=16)\n",
    "- **Resolution**: Approximately 0.008 mV (8 µV) per LSB at ±0.256V range \n",
    "- **Effective accuracy**: Better than 0.2 mV resolution even at higher ranges \n",
    "\n",
    "**Differential Mode Advantage**\n",
    "For measuring very small voltages (like across a shunt resistor), **differential mode** provides superior performance:\n",
    "- Eliminates offset drift\n",
    "- Achieves down to **1 LSB drift** after calibration \n",
    "- Real-world example: 0.025% accuracy matching a multimeter within 50 µA on a 200mA range \n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Considerations for Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Input Impedance Effects**\n",
    "The ADS1115's input impedance varies with gain setting - it's highest (around **22 MΩ**) at the largest full-scale range . For high-impedance sources (>10 kΩ), this can significantly affect measurement accuracy. A voltage divider or source impedance will cause voltage drop, so you must account for loading effects .\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Gain Selection**\n",
    "Choose the smallest range that accommodates your maximum expected signal:\n",
    "- For sub-millivolt signals: Use ±0.256V range (gain=16)\n",
    "- For ~0.1-1V signals: Use ±1.024V range (gain=4) \n",
    "**Caution**: Exceeding the range causes clipping and invalid readings \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Common Ground Requirement**\n",
    "All inputs must remain between **GND and VDD** (absolute max: GND-0.3V to VDD+0.3V) . Even in differential mode, a common ground connection is required for valid measurements .\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Source Impedance**\n",
    "Keep source impedance low. The ADS1115 can handle up to **10 mA** input current through its protection diodes, but high source impedance introduces measurement errors .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use differential inputs** for the best noise rejection and accuracy  \n",
    "✅ **Select the highest appropriate gain** (smallest FSR) for your signal  \n",
    "✅ **Ensure proper grounding** between signal source and ADS1115  \n",
    "✅ **Add series resistors** (if needed) to limit current through protection diodes  \n",
    "✅ **Calibrate your system** to achieve <0.1% accuracy   \n",
    "✅ **Consider input impedance** when measuring high-impedance sources \n",
    "\n",
    "The ADS1115 is well-suited for low-voltage applications like measuring small sensor outputs, voltage drops across shunt resistors, or thermocouple signals, provided you configure it correctly and understand its input limitations."
