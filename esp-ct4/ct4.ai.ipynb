    "## Legacy Code Review & Refactoring Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "You are right to review this code before transitioning fully to ESP32. The legacy code reflects patterns common in memory-constrained 8-bit microcontrollers (like global buffers and pointers), but the ESP32 allows for safer, more robust object-oriented patterns without sacrificing significant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues Identified in Legacy Code\n",
    "1.  **Global State & coupling:** Variables like `itopic`, `idev`, `ipayload`, and `NEW_MAIL` are global. This makes the code brittle; if you have two places checking for mail, they might conflict. It also breaks \"Encapsulation\".\n",
    "2.  **Safety:** Extensive use of `strcpy` and `strcat` on `char` arrays without strict bounds checking is a major source of buffer overflow bugs (crashes).\n",
    "3.  **Blocking Code:** The `reconn()` function uses `delay(5000)`. During this 5-second pause, your ESP32 cannot read sensors, handle web requests, or blink LEDs. This is the biggest issue for a \"smart\" device.\n",
    "4.  **Hardcoded Parsing:** The topic parsing (`b = 15`) relies on specific topic lengths/structures, which makes adapting to new projects difficult.\n",
    "5.  **Separation of Concerns:** The networking logic (connecting) and the business logic (interpreting \"log\" vs \"time\") are mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Architecture: The \"Manager\" Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a `MqttManager` class that:\n",
    "1.  **Encapsulates** the connection logic and state.\n",
    "2.  **Non-blocking:** Uses a state machine in a `loop()` method to handle reconnections seamlessly.\n",
    "3.  **Modern Callbacks:** Uses `std::function` (available in ESP32) to let your main application define *what* to do with a message, while the Manager handles *how* to receive it.\n",
    "4.  **Safer Strings:** Uses `std::string` or Arduino `String` types for easier and safer text manipulation, or robustly managed `char` buffers if strict memory management is needed (less critical on ESP32).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Refactored Code\n",

    "*   **Clean Parsing:** `onMessage` handles converting raw bytes to Strings and stripping the device ID prefix. Your `handleAppMessage` only deals with `cmd/led` or `time`, not `CYURD127/cmd/led`.\n",
    "*   **Separation:** You can change `handleAppMessage` to do whatever you want (toggle relays, update variables) without touching the `MqttManager` code.\n"

    "Your approach of having a highly reusable `main.cpp` controlled by a `CONFIG` file is excellent, especially for managing a fleet of varied devices. To keep this cleanly organized in C++, here is the standard pattern to achieve exactly what you described.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Where do the Constants go? (`.h` vs `.cpp`)\n",
    "For configuration constants like WiFi and MQTT credentials, they should go in a **header file** (`Config.h` or `Secrets.h`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Avoid:** Putting `const char* var = \"val\"` directly in a `.h` file if it is included by multiple `.cpp` files (this causes \"multiple definition\" linker errors).\n",
    "*   **Best Practice:** Use `#define` or `constexpr` in a header file.\n",

    "1.  **Single Source of Truth:** If you later switch to an ESP8266 (which uses different default I2C pins D1/D2) or a different ESP32 board, you don't have to hunt through `ct.cpp` or `Sensor.cpp` or `main.cpp`. You just open `Config.h`, change the numbers, and hit upload.\n",
    "2.  **Documentation:** The file itself becomes the documentation for the wiring. You can look at `Config.h` and immediately know how to wire up the PCB or breadboard.\n",

The `main.cpp` and `CTSensor.h` files remain identical binary blobs (libraries) shared by all 50 devices.\n",

    "1.  **Low/Incorrect Readings (1.85A vs 12A)**: This was caused by **integer overflow** in the `long sumSquares` variable. With 2000 samples squared, the sum exceeds the 32-bit `long` limit ($2^{31}$), wrapping around to negative or small positive numbers, destroying the RMS calculation.\n",
    "2.  **Connectivity/Blocking**: The user requested a \"split\" approach where readings are taken incrementally to avoid blocking the main loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Combined State Machine & Double Precision\n",

    "#### 1. Precision Fix (`CTSensor.h`)\n",
    "*   Changed accumulator to `double _sumSquares` (64-bit float). This eliminates the overflow issue entirely and guarantees accurate RMS math for 2000+ samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Architecture Change: Non-Blocking State Machine\n",
    "Instead of a blocking `for` loop, the sensor now has internal states:\n",
    "*   `IDLE`: Waiting for scheduler.\n",
    "*   `SAMPLING_INIT`: Sets gain, performs settling delays.\n",
    "*   `SAMPLING_RUN`: Takes **10 samples** (taking ~80ms), then returns control to `loop()`.\n",
    "*   `SAMPLING_DONE`: Calculates RMS and publishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Scheduler Update (`main.cpp`)\n",
    "The main loop now manages the sensor execution explicitly:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "void loop() {\n",
    "  mqtt.loop(); // Runs FREELY every cycle (~10ms)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  if (isActive) {\n",

    "Here is the data on \"Optimum Settings\" for 60Hz:\n",

    "### The \"Optimum\" 60Hz Spec\n",
    "To measure 60Hz AC specifically (16.6ms per cycle), the physical limits of the ADS1115 dictate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **SPS (Samples Per Second):** You **must use 860 SPS** (the maximum).\n",
    "    *   *Why:* 60Hz requires at least 240 samples/sec for vague accuracy, but much higher is better for RMS.\n",
    "    *   *Default:* The ADS1115 defaults to **128 SPS** if not specified (only ~2 samples per AC cycle).\n",
    "2.  **Duration:** You need to sample for **at least 60 cycles (1 second)** to get stable noise-free data.\n",
    "    *   *Calculation:* 1 second × 860 SPS = **860 Samples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of `esp-ct4a` (Reference Code)\n",
    "I read your reference code in ct.cpp. It \"works,\" but it forces the ESP32 to effectively sleep-walk:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **It uses `samples = 2000`**\n",
    "2.  **It uses default Speed (128 SPS)**\n",
    "    *   *Math:* 2000 samples × (1/128 sec) ≈ **15.6 seconds** of blocking time **PER SENSOR**.\n",
    "3.  **Why it stabilized:** Averaging over 15 seconds will smooth out almost anything, but it makes the UI/MQTT unresponsive for up to a minute at a time if you have 4 sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Polite\" Solution\n",
    "We can match the **stability** of the reference code (using 2000-ish data points) but achieve it in **2.5 seconds** instead of 16 seconds by cranking the speed, AND keep MQTT alive by interleaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Settings for CTSensor.h:**\n",

    "*   **Target:** `_targetSamples = 1000;` (Wait for ~1.2 seconds of data)\n",
    "*   **Chunk Size:** Process ~10 samples per loop (takes ~12ms), then yield to MQTT.\n",

    "**User Observation:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Analysis of Timing:**\n",
    "If the legacy code (2000 samples) took ~2.3 seconds, the effective rate is:\n",
    "$2000 \\text{ samples} / 2.3 \\text{ seconds} \\approx 870 \\text{ samples/sec}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that the hardware is **already capable of running at ~860 SPS** (Samples Per Second), which is the maximum speed of the ADS1115. My initial concern that it might default to 128 SPS (15 seconds) was proven wrong by your empirical test (the library likely negotiated a faster speed or the \"readADC\" delay is shorter than the worst-case spec).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we still need to refactor:**\n",
    "Even though 2.3 seconds is better than 15 seconds, **blocking the main loop for 2.3 seconds is fatal** for good MQTT/WiFi performance. The ESP32 cannot respond to network pings or KeepAlives during that freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Refactored Plan:**\n",
    "We will stick to the **Polite Cooperative** model, but we can be confident in our parameters:\n",
    "1.  **Rate:** Explicitly set `RATE_ADS1115_860SPS` to guarantee that high speed.\n",
    "2.  **Window:** 2000 samples (2.3s) is \"gold standard\" but 1000 samples (1.15s) is \"silver standard\" and perfectly adequate for home energy monitoring.\n",
    "3.  **Chunking:** The critical piece is breaking that 1.15s (or 2.3s) job into 50+ tiny chunks so the background network tasks never starve.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question:** How long can the MQTT loop be blocked before we lose connection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "You have a safety margin of approximately **10-12 seconds** (with the default settings), so your **2-3 second blocking time** was actually safe from a disconnect perspective, though bad for responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Mechanics:**\n",
    "1.  **Default KeepAlive:** The standard `PubSubClient` library defaults to **15 seconds**.\n",
    "2.  **Broker Tolerance:** Brokers typically wait **1.5x** the KeepAlive interval (approx **22.5 seconds**) before forcibly disconnecting you.\n",
    "3.  **Client Logic:** The ESP32 must run `mqtt.loop()` frequently enough to send a \"Ping\" packet at least once every 15 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zones of Danger:**\n",
    "*   **Safe Zone (< 5 seconds):** Connection is stable, but UI/Messages might feel \"laggy\".\n",
    "*   **Danger Zone (5 - 15 seconds):** You risk missing the window to send a Ping if there is any network latency.\n",
    "*   **Dead Zone (> 15 seconds):** The client will likely self-disconnect or the broker will drop you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "While your 2-3 second block worked, moving to the **Polite Cooperative** model (blocking for only ~12ms) eliminates lag entirely and makes the system robust against network hiccups."
