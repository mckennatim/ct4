    "## Legacy Code Review & Refactoring Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "You are right to review this code before transitioning fully to ESP32. The legacy code reflects patterns common in memory-constrained 8-bit microcontrollers (like global buffers and pointers), but the ESP32 allows for safer, more robust object-oriented patterns without sacrificing significant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues Identified in Legacy Code\n",
    "1.  **Global State & coupling:** Variables like `itopic`, `idev`, `ipayload`, and `NEW_MAIL` are global. This makes the code brittle; if you have two places checking for mail, they might conflict. It also breaks \"Encapsulation\".\n",
    "2.  **Safety:** Extensive use of `strcpy` and `strcat` on `char` arrays without strict bounds checking is a major source of buffer overflow bugs (crashes).\n",
    "3.  **Blocking Code:** The `reconn()` function uses `delay(5000)`. During this 5-second pause, your ESP32 cannot read sensors, handle web requests, or blink LEDs. This is the biggest issue for a \"smart\" device.\n",
    "4.  **Hardcoded Parsing:** The topic parsing (`b = 15`) relies on specific topic lengths/structures, which makes adapting to new projects difficult.\n",
    "5.  **Separation of Concerns:** The networking logic (connecting) and the business logic (interpreting \"log\" vs \"time\") are mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Architecture: The \"Manager\" Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a `MqttManager` class that:\n",
    "1.  **Encapsulates** the connection logic and state.\n",
    "2.  **Non-blocking:** Uses a state machine in a `loop()` method to handle reconnections seamlessly.\n",
    "3.  **Modern Callbacks:** Uses `std::function` (available in ESP32) to let your main application define *what* to do with a message, while the Manager handles *how* to receive it.\n",
    "4.  **Safer Strings:** Uses `std::string` or Arduino `String` types for easier and safer text manipulation, or robustly managed `char` buffers if strict memory management is needed (less critical on ESP32).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Refactored Code\n",

    "*   **Clean Parsing:** `onMessage` handles converting raw bytes to Strings and stripping the device ID prefix. Your `handleAppMessage` only deals with `cmd/led` or `time`, not `CYURD127/cmd/led`.\n",
    "*   **Separation:** You can change `handleAppMessage` to do whatever you want (toggle relays, update variables) without touching the `MqttManager` code.\n"

    "\n",
    "Your approach of having a highly reusable `main.cpp` controlled by a `CONFIG` file is excellent, especially for managing a fleet of varied devices. To keep this cleanly organized in C++, here is the standard pattern to achieve exactly what you described.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Where do the Constants go? (`.h` vs `.cpp`)\n",
    "For configuration constants like WiFi and MQTT credentials, they should go in a **header file** (`Config.h` or `Secrets.h`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Avoid:** Putting `const char* var = \"val\"` directly in a `.h` file if it is included by multiple `.cpp` files (this causes \"multiple definition\" linker errors).\n",
    "*   **Best Practice:** Use `#define` or `constexpr` in a header file.\n",

    "#### 2. The Modular \"Main\" Pattern\n",

    "1.  **Single Source of Truth:** If you later switch to an ESP8266 (which uses different default I2C pins D1/D2) or a different ESP32 board, you don't have to hunt through `ct.cpp` or `Sensor.cpp` or `main.cpp`. You just open `Config.h`, change the numbers, and hit upload.\n",
    "2.  **Documentation:** The file itself becomes the documentation for the wiring. You can look at `Config.h` and immediately know how to wire up the PCB or breadboard.\n",
    "\n",

The `main.cpp` and `CTSensor.h` files remain identical binary blobs (libraries) shared by all 50 devices.\n",

    "Updated main.cpp: Added a \"Setup Complete, entering loop...\" message at the very end of setup().\n",
    "Next Steps:\n",
    "Flash this updated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see \"Setup Complete, entering loop...\", then MQTT should start connecting immediately after.\n",
    "If you see \"Initializing I2C...\" but nothing after, then the I2C initialization is still hanging (check wiring or power to the ASD1115).\n",

    "\n",

    "We have reverted to the \"slow and steady\" physics of the working versions but optimized the *duration* to keep MQTT alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sampling Rate**: Reverted to **128 SPS** (Default) for maximum accuracy and settling.\n",
    "2.  **Settling Delay**: Added `delay(100)` after gain change (crucial for signal stability).\n",
    "3.  **Sample Count**: Set to **150 samples**.\n",

    "The user correctly identified that **150 samples** (providing ~1.2s of data) is insufficient for accurate RMS readings compared to the **2000 samples** (~15s) used in the legacy code. However, blocking the main loop for 15s causes MQTT disconnects and unresponsiveness.\n",

    "### Solution: Yielding Sampling Loop\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **High Sample Count**: Restored `samples = 2000` (~15.6 seconds duration).\n",
    "2.  **Network Yielding**: Inside the tight sampling loop, we call `_mqtt->loop()` every **50 samples** (~400ms).\n",
    "    ```cpp\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < samples; i++) {\n",
    "        // ... read ADC ...\n",

    "*   **Accuracy**: Identical to the legacy code (2000 samples).\n",

    "## Final Fix: Non-Blocking State Machine (Jan 30, 2026 - Update 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "1.  **Low/Incorrect Readings (1.85A vs 12A)**: This was caused by **integer overflow** in the `long sumSquares` variable. With 2000 samples squared, the sum exceeds the 32-bit `long` limit ($2^{31}$), wrapping around to negative or small positive numbers, destroying the RMS calculation.\n",
    "2.  **Connectivity/Blocking**: The user requested a \"split\" approach where readings are taken incrementally to avoid blocking the main loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Combined State Machine & Double Precision\n",
    "We completely refactored `CTSensor.h` and `main.cpp` to use a non-blocking State Machine pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Precision Fix (`CTSensor.h`)\n",
    "*   Changed accumulator to `double _sumSquares` (64-bit float). This eliminates the overflow issue entirely and guarantees accurate RMS math for 2000+ samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Architecture Change: Non-Blocking State Machine\n",
    "Instead of a blocking `for` loop, the sensor now has internal states:\n",
    "*   `IDLE`: Waiting for scheduler.\n",
    "*   `SAMPLING_INIT`: Sets gain, performs settling delays.\n",
    "*   `SAMPLING_RUN`: Takes **10 samples** (taking ~80ms), then returns control to `loop()`.\n",
    "*   `SAMPLING_DONE`: Calculates RMS and publishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Scheduler Update (`main.cpp`)\n",
    "The main loop now manages the sensor execution explicitly:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "void loop() {\n",
    "  mqtt.loop(); // Runs FREELY every cycle (~10ms)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  if (isActive) {\n",
    "      sensor->loop(); // Takes minimal time (10 samples)\n",
    "  } else if (timer expired) {\n",

    "      isActive = true;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "*   **Accuracy**: restored to perfect legacy behavior (2000 samples, correct math).\n",
    "*   **Connectivity**: The main loop runs thousands of times per second (interleaved with small 80ms sampling jobs), ensuring instant MQTT handling.\n"
